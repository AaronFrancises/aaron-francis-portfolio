# Future Session Continuation Prompt

## High-Level Context
You're working on Aaron Francis's cinematography portfolio website. The project has gone through systematic optimization with focus on clean carousel animations, custom branding elements, and performance improvements.

## What We Just Completed (Session 11)
- **Systematic Reversion**: Removed all enhanced animations and complex visual effects from previous session
- **Carousel Optimization**: Fine-tuned positioning of distant (10% top) and main (47% top) carousels
- **Video Synchronization Fix**: Implemented randomized delays to prevent clunky 5-second video restart sync
- **Custom Cursor System**: Created red triangle cursor with vibration animations matching logo design
- **Triangle Play Button**: Implemented red triangle play button in video-player.css matching brand identity
- **Portfolio Button Revert**: Applied then reverted triangle design from portfolio play buttons per user request

## Current State Analysis
- Clean, optimized carousel system without sync issues
- Custom branding elements (cursor, video player) maintain brand consistency
- All enhanced animation systems have been removed for cleaner performance
- Video timing is properly staggered with randomized delays

## Key Files to Review
@Styles/Components/custom-cursor.css
@Styles/Components/video-player.css
@Styles/Components/portfolio.css

@index.html
@Changelog.md

## Next Steps & Potential Tasks
1. **Performance Optimization**: Test and optimize carousel performance across devices
2. **Branding Consistency**: Apply triangle design to other interactive elements if needed
3. **Testing**: Cross-browser and device testing for cursor and carousel systems
4. **Polish**: Final refinements based on user feedback
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure custom cursor and carousels work optimally on mobile

## Technical Notes
- Custom cursor uses CSS triangles with `border` technique matching logo animation
- Video player triangle uses rotated 90deg triangle with red accent color and glow effects
- Carousel videos have randomized animation delays ranging from -0.1s to -4.8s
- Main carousel positioned at 47% top, distant at 10% top with 220vw width
- All enhanced animations from Session 10 have been systematically removed

## User Preferences
- Prefers clean, optimized systems over complex animations
- Values brand consistency (red triangle motif from logo)
- Wants smooth carousel experience without synchronization issues
- Requests specific positioning adjustments based on visual feedback
