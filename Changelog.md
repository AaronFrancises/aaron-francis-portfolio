# Changelog Workflow

- All development changes are tracked in `Changelog.md` in this folder.
- At the end of each session, update `Changelog.md` with a summary of changes and a Next Steps section.
- Previous changelogs can be found in`/Archive` 
- NEW: Prepend entries at TOP of file after this workflow section (improved efficiency)
- ADDITIVE ONLY.
- Use bullet points and emojis for clarity (ðŸŸ© new, ðŸŸ¥ fix, ðŸŸ¦ improvement, ðŸŸª refactor).
